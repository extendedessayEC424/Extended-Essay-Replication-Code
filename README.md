Navigating High-Inflation States: The Role and Effectiveness of Monetary Policy

Abstract

What is the dynamic response of inflation to monetary policy shock in different
inflationary states? Does the effectiveness of monetary policy reduce in periods of
high inflation? The paper discusses three key channels through which the ‘infla-
tionary’ state of the economy may impact monetary policy effectiveness - (i) state
dependency of price stickiness, (ii) heterogeneous agents and inflation expectations
and (iii) rational (in)attentiveness and inflation expectations. A non-linear local
projection is used to study the dynamic response of inflation to monetary policy
shocks in various inflationary states. Dummy variables are used to identify four
inflation regimes ranging from very low to high in the local projection specification.
The paper uses an external instrument for monetary policy shock, and the impulse
responses are estimated using an instrumental variable local projection. This thesis
finds monetary policy to be less effective in a high-inflation state1.

Keywords: monetary policy, inflation, state-dependent effects.
